        <p> Football has to be my favourite hobby and sport. I look forward towards and enjoy playing it 3 times a week. To me football is more than just physical fitness, it's also a form of stress relief and an opportunity to be social with my peers and experience euphoric feelings.

My favourite team is Arsenal and surprisingly enough, although I enjoy playing football, I struggle to sit down and watch 90 minutes of it on TV!</p>

My favourite console games at the moment are:</p>

        <p>I enjoy reading, this was one of my favourite hobbies on my way to and back from high school. My favourite author at the time was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malorie+blackman+books&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB969GB969&sxsrf=AJOqlzVDOvV5jONx6ar6O23j7xas_cFx4g%3A1674146107217&ei=O3HJY5_tDIaChbIPg_af0Aw&oq=Malorie+Blackman&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAxgBMggILhCxAxCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIICC4QgAQQ1AIyBQguEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDoECCMQJzoFCAAQkQI6CwguEMcBENEDEJECOgsILhCDARCxAxCABDoLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwE6DgguEMcBELEDENEDEIAEOg4ILhCABBCxAxDHARDRAzoLCC4QgAQQsQMQgwE6CwguEIAEEMcBENEDOgQIABBDOgcILhDUAhBDOgwIABCxAxBDEEYQ-QE6BwgAELEDEEM6CggAELEDEIMBEEM6BAguEEM6CgguELEDEIMBEEM6CAguEIAEELEDOgoILhCxAxDUAhBDOgsILhCABBDHARCvAToICAAQgAQQsQNKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQAFiTEGDrGWgBcAF4AIABdIgB5QqSAQQxNS4ymAEAoAEBwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#cobssid=s" target=”_blank”>Malorie Blackman</a>.
